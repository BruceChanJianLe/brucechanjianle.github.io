> Chan Jian Le

I'm a software developer in Singapore.


I'm working in the robotics field.
I primarily program in C++ and Python within the Linux environment.
Passionate about working in the terminal, I create custom CLI tools to streamline
my development workflow, of course, not to mention Vim!


I enjoy exploring new technologies to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge.
Currently, I'm diving into Nix Shell.
