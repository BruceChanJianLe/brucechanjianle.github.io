I'm a software developer in Singapore.


Currently, I'm working in the robotics field.
Majority of my time, I program in C++ and python in the Linux realm.
I create my own cli tools for butter-smooth development workflow as I love working in the terminal, of course, not to mention vim!

Now and then I would try out new things to improve.
At the moment, I am learning Nix Shell.
