> Setup your dotfiles blazingly fast with ease!

Dotfiles are configuration files for various applications and system settings,
often stored in your home directory and named with a preceding dot (.),
which makes them hidden by default in Unix-based systems.
They are essential for customizing your development environment and workflow!


For a cleaner home directory, it is encouraged that dotfiles are stored into
the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory. There are also recommended practices for user-
specific data files and caches.


VARIABLE NAME | DEFAULT PATH | REMARKS
--- | --- | ---
XDG_CONFIG_HOME | `~/.config` | Stores configuration files.
XDG_DATA_HOME | `~/.local/share` | Stores user-specific data files, like app data that isn’t configuration (e.g., bookmarks or sessions).
XDG_CACHE_HOME | `~/.cache` | Stores cache files, which can be deleted without losing important data.

Now that we understand what dotfiles are, we also want to know why they’re important. 
Dotfiles are crucial because they define your personal development environment,
including everything from terminal color themes, shell aliases,
and keybindings to complex tool configurations and plugins.
These settings shape your workflow, tailoring it to your preferences and optimizing productivity.
Having these dotfiles properly configured and tracked enables you
to recreate your environment on a new laptop or system effortlessly,
saving significant setup time and ensuring continuity across devices.
