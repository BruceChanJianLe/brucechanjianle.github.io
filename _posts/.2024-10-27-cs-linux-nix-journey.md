> Let's dive into using Nix for development!

## Installation

Using official installation steps: https://nixos.org/download/#nix-install-linux


What the script would do:

- make sure your computer doesn't already have Nix files
 (if it does, I will tell you how to clean them up.)
- create local users (see the list above for the users I'll make)
- create a local group (nixbld)
- install Nix in /nix
- create a configuration file in /etc/nix
- set up the "default profile" by creating some Nix-related files in
 /root
- back up /etc/bash.bashrc to /etc/bash.bashrc.backup-before-nix
- update /etc/bash.bashrc to include some Nix configuration
- back up /etc/zsh/zshrc to /etc/zsh/zshrc.backup-before-nix
- update /etc/zsh/zshrc to include some Nix configuration
- load and start a service (at /etc/systemd/system/nix-daemon.service
 and /etc/systemd/system/nix-daemon.socket) for nix-daemon


The script is quite intuitive, just read through the prompt carefully,
and response as required.


If you want a quick way, you can checkout my the below command:

```bash
ansible-pull https://github.com/BruceChanJianLe/ansible-nix.git -K
```

Unistalling

```bash
# Delete the Nix store (and misc. Nix-related files) as root
sudo rm -rf /nix/
# Delete the Nix configuration file as root
sudo rm -rf /etc/nix
# Delete your user links as normal user
sudo rm -rf ~/.nix-channels ~/.nix-defexpr ~/.nix-profile
```

## Setting Up Experimental Feature

Well, nix commands and flakes belongs to the experimental features, which
is what the people are using nix for, so let's learn how we can enable them.


Basically, there are two ways to enable it. System-wide method, which all users
will have the experimental features. Or you could do it per-user based.
Let's explore the method for system-wide first.

```bash
sudoedit /etc/nix/nix.conf
```

Add this line to it..
```conf
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```


For user only method, which is what I would recommend:

```bash
mkdir ~/.config/nix/ -p
vim ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

Add this line to it..
```conf
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```
